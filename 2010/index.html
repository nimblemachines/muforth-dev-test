<p>While it might <em>appear</em> that work on muforth has ceased entirely, such appearances are mere illusion. A look at the <a href="http://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/graphs/contributors/">Github repo</a> will show several bursts of activity. I spent most of September &amp; October of 2009 working feverishly on the HC08 and HCS08 support, developing a nifty simple bootloader for the chips, and mastering eldritch art of programming the flash memory (which is different on the two families!).</p>
<p>Then, this past February, I returned to the <a href="http://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/commits/master/mu/target/ARM">ARM support</a> and hacked feverishly on <em>that</em> for a month or so &ndash; creating a completely new target compiler, and re-writing and augmenting the ARM kernel to be direct-threaded (rather than subroutine-threaded), and self-hosting. That was the first time I had written a target compiler that compiles names (ie, a dictionary) on both the host and target. The definitions of defining words in such a system really become mind-bending...</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently experimenting with some novel (for muforth) features, such as 32-way hashing of the dictionary, robust &amp; portable double number support (in C &ndash; God help me), and a refactoring of the &ldquo;platform&rdquo; support code (so muforth could, in principle, run on non-*nix-alike platforms).</p>
<p>I look forward to someday returning to the HC08 work. I was having a great time last fall working on it, and still have high hopes for using the chips in practice.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
